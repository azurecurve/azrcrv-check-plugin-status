# Description

This plugin allows you to check the status of plugins on your site:
 * Are they in the WordPress Repository.
 * Do they use a 3rd party update mechanism such as [Update Manager](https://codepotent.com/classicpress/plugins/) from [Code Potent](https://codepotent.com/)
 * Are they supported on ClassicPress or on WordPress 5+.
 * Are they up-to-date.
 
Exception handling has been built in for [Contact Form 7](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) and [Google Sitemap Generator](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/) which report a different slug in the API to the slug on the Wordpress Repository.

# Installation Instructions

* Download the latest release of the plugin from [GitHub](https://github.com/azurecurve/azrcrv-check-plugin-status/releases/latest/).
* Upload the entire zip file using the Plugins upload function in your ClassicPress admin panel.
* Activate the plugin.
* Configure settings.
